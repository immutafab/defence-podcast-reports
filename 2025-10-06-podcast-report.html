<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>North Korea is set to unveil new strategic missiles and hypersonic weapons at an upcoming military parade, signaling a significant enhancement in its strike capabilities against the US and South Korea. Meanwhile, China has escalated tensions in the South China Sea by deploying bombers and warships to the Scarborough Shoal, directly challenging the Philippines and its allies.</p>
<p>In defense technology, RTX has secured a $5 billion order for anti-drone missiles, aimed at providing a cost-effective solution to counter drone threats. The Defense Innovation Unit has initiated the Counter UAS NEXT project, selecting two companies to develop advanced solutions against drone threats. Additionally, Sierra Nevada Corp. has introduced the BRAWLR air defense system, which has reportedly neutralized numerous aerial threats.</p>
<p>Firefly Aerospace is expanding its defense market presence by acquiring SciTec for $855 million. The US is also leveraging AI infrastructure in the Arabian Gulf to project power, while a potential US-Ukraine drone technology deal could grant the US access to Ukraine&rsquo;s battlefield-tested systems in exchange for royalties.</p>
